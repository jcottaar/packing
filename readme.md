This repository contains the winning solution for the Santa 2025 competition on Kaggle. The 'main' branch contains a simplified version of the code, while the 'full' branch contains the full code used to develop and create my solution.

If you want to learn about the solution and this code, you're best off looking at my writeup (https://kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/writeups/1st-place-genetic-algorithm-and-gpu-relaxation) and example notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeroencottaar/santa-2025-1st-place-solution).

This code is released under CC BY-SA 4.0, meaning you can freely use and adapt 
it (including commercially), but must give credit to the original author 
(Jeroen Cottaar) and keep it under this license.
